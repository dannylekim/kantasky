# Issues

## Things to do next

Adjust apis to reflect new model changes 
    -> Tasks
    -> Groups
    -> Users
Add an expiration to JWT 

# Things that still need to be done

passport FB and google?
Everything on the todo obviously
Attaching users and tasks to each other following the data structure
Group API 
web-api notification -> set a notification on the user, web page checks if, if there, open a notification
Email/SMS Notification
Timer that starts how long you've been working on the task
Inviting people to groups
charts
Android app written in Kotlin
Username checks in the db

Read more about mongo schemas in hopes to optimizing

# Important 

Reorganize and refactor to be using promises and arrow functions
Logging functions to keep stack trace -- Winston
Write API Documentation -- Swagger
Proper Error Handling
Separate app and server
Make a util folder and have your utility methods inside or package them as a npm package
Signup and login string checks
Use ESLint and eslint-plugin-node, eslint-plugin-mocha and eslint-plugin-node-security
Name callback functions
Require on folders not files

decide if you want to do promises or await (await looks cleaner imo)

rather than unit tests, do API tests
Use a CI
e2e tests? 

using all cores, app probs uses but 1
Keep frontend assets out of node
set NODE_ENV to production when out to prod

### Maybe 

Unit Tests -> maybe not to TDD in this project, but another personal project dedicated to TDD 


    -> though it would be useful to have when making sure the whole api stack isn't broken 
argon2 hashing algorithm over bcrypt
