# Issues



## Things to do next
Refactoring using awaits/promises while documenting
Proper Logging -- Winston 
Test all the api routes using API tests
refactor all checks
Instead of giving errors at 200, maybe at 500 for status? Also do an unhandled promise error handler
Creating Admin Only Paths rather than making the checks within the methods. 


Timer that tracks how long you're working on the task 
Notifications/SMS/Email for invitations --> Socket based for notifications? (socket.io)
passport FB and google
set NODE_ENV to production when out to prod
Optimize everything


# Things that still need to be done
charts
Android app written in Kotlin
Read more about mongo schemas in hopes to optimizing cuz it's a hot steaming pile of garbage

# Important 
Use a CI
e2e tests? 

using all cores, app probs uses but 1
Keep frontend assets out of node
