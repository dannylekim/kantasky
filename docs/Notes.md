# Issues

## Things to do next

Adjust apis to reflect new model changes 
    -> Tasks
    -> Groups
    -> Users
Add an expiration to JWT 

# Things that still need to be done

passport FB and google?
Implement angular templating into the project
    -> use the UI kit PaperKit 2 Angular 4
Everything on the todo obviously
Attaching users and tasks to each other following the data structure
Group API 
web-api notification -> set a notification on the user, web page checks if, if there, open a notification
Email/SMS Notification
Timer that starts how long you've been working on the task
Inviting people to groups
charts
Android app written in Kotlin
Username checks in the db

# Important 

Reorganize and refactor to be using promises and arrow functions
Logging functions to keep stack trace -- Winston


### Maybe 

Unit Tests -> maybe not to TDD in this project, but another personal project dedicated to TDD 
    -> though it would be useful to have when making sure the whole api stack isn't broken 
argon2 hashing algorithm over bcrypt
